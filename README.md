- 👋 Hi, I’m @Scunthorpe27
- 👀 I’m interested in random languages and geography.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning several different languages, like Arabic, Russian, Ukrainian, Japanese, Chinese, French and German. OH you mean coding languages! I'm learning C++, HTML/CSS, JS and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on CTF-related ideas, or C++ programming.
